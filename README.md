# SprigCase3D
Case for Hack Club's sprig

This is currently still a work in progress. The case consists of two parts, a top and a bottom, and will eventually have clips to hold them together.
Due to complications with github and STL meshes, there are multiple copies/versions of each file. When the case is complete I'll add a release, but for now if you want to see the models just get the most recently committed version of `Part Studio 1 - Part 1` (bottom) and `Part Studio 2 - Part 1` (top).
